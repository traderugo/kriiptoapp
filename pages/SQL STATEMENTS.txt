Formulas for Trade Calculator

Given Parameters:
- capital = Total capital available
- risk (%) = Percentage of capital risked per trade
- entry = Entry price of the trade
- tp = Take Profit price
- sl = Stop Loss price
- leverage = Leverage used on the trade

Calculations:

1. Risk Amount:
   riskAmount = (capital * risk) / 100

2. Price Difference to Stop Loss:
   priceDiffSL = |entry - sl|

3. Price Difference to Take Profit:
   priceDiffTP = |tp - entry|

4. Position Size (units/contracts):
   positionSize = riskAmount / priceDiffSL

5. Notional Size:
   notionalSize = positionSize * entry

6. Margin Required:
   margin = notionalSize / leverage

7. Risk-Reward Ratio (RR):
   RR = priceDiffTP / priceDiffSL

8. ROI (based on risk % and RR):
   ROI = RR * risk

9. Percentage Change in Price:
   pctChange = ((tp - entry) / entry) * 100

10. Absolute ROI (relative to margin):
    absROI = ((priceDiffTP * positionSize) / margin) * 100
